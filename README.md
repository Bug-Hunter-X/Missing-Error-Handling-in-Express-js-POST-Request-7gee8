# Missing Error Handling in Express.js POST Request

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: missing error handling for missing request bodies in POST requests.

## Bug

The `bug.js` file contains an Express.js server that handles POST requests to the `/users` endpoint.  It expects a JSON payload containing user data. However, it lacks error handling for cases where the request body is missing or invalid.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the server.  It includes comprehensive error handling to check for missing or invalid request bodies and return appropriate error responses.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install Express.js.
4. Run `node bug.js`.
5. Send a POST request to `http://localhost:3000/users` without a request body or with an invalid JSON payload.  Observe the server's response (or lack thereof).
6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 with `node bugSolution.js` to see the improved error handling.
